Narration: The gross profit analysis check helps you select enterprises (income-generating activities) that contribute most to covering your overhead costs.

Narration: The question you ask is: **"Which enterprises contribute the most to covering the overheads of the business?"**

Narration: Gross profit = Income from enterprise - Additional costs you wouldn't have without that enterprise. The enterprise with the highest gross profit helps cover your fixed costs (rent, insurance, basic utilities) most effectively.

Narration: A financial analysis robot nearby is calculating the profitability of selling individual grains of sand. Its precision is impressive, though its business model needs work.

**Example Scenario**: You're choosing between three potential income sources for your homestead.

- @gpa_example_vegetables: Sell vegetables at farmers market (Income: $2000/month, Additional costs: $800/month)
- @gpa_example_consulting: Offer permaculture consulting (Income: $1500/month, Additional costs: $200/month)  
- @gpa_example_workshops: Run weekend workshops (Income: $1000/month, Additional costs: $300/month)

@gpa_example_vegetables
title: Vegetable Sales
subtitle: High income, high costs

Narration: **Gross Profit**: $2000 income - $800 additional costs = **$1200/month**

Narration: Vegetables generate the highest income but also require significant additional costs for seeds, market fees, transportation, packaging, and extra labor.

@gpa_example_consulting
title: Permaculture Consulting
subtitle: Moderate income, low costs

Narration: **Gross Profit**: $1500 income - $200 additional costs = **$1300/month**

Narration: Consulting has lower income but very low additional costs - mainly transportation and some materials. This gives the highest gross profit despite lower total income.

@gpa_example_workshops
title: Weekend Workshops
subtitle: Lower income, moderate costs

Narration: **Gross Profit**: $1000 income - $300 additional costs = **$700/month**

title: Understanding Gross Profit Analysis
subtitle: Income vs. Additional Costs

Narration: **Key concepts**:
- **Additional costs**: Only costs you wouldn't have without this enterprise
- **Fixed costs not included**: Rent, basic utilities, insurance - you pay these anyway
- **Gross profit covers overheads**: The enterprise with highest gross profit best covers your fixed costs

Narration: **Common mistake**: Choosing enterprises based on total income rather than gross profit. A high-income enterprise with high additional costs might contribute less to your bottom line than a moderate-income enterprise with low additional costs.

Narration: This analysis helps you select the combination of enterprises that maximizes your ability to cover overhead and generate actual profit.
