Narration: Great question! At this point, no practice is better than others, because that can only be determined once you have your context - which we're creating right now.

Narration: A repair drone hovers nearby, apparently trying to fix a broken streetlight by singing to it. Without context about what the light is supposed to do, even the best intentions go astray.

Narration: Think of it this way: if someone asks "Should I use organic farming or conventional farming?" the answer depends entirely on their context. What are they trying to achieve? What's their situation? What are their values?

Narration: Once you're clear on how you want your life to be, then you can evaluate which practices actually support that vision.
