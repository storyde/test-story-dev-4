Narration: The sustainability check asks you to consider the long-term environmental and social consequences of your actions relative to your holistic context.

Narration: The question you ask is: **"If we take this action, will it lead toward or away from the future resource base described in our holistic context?"**

Narration: This check ensures your short-term actions support your long-term vision. It's about making decisions that benefit both present and future.

Narration: A planning robot nearby is optimizing today's efficiency by burning tomorrow's resources. It's achieving excellent short-term metrics while undermining long-term sustainability.

**Example Scenario**: Your community needs more energy, and you're considering options.

- @sus_example_coal: Build a coal power plant for cheap, reliable energy
- @sus_example_solar: Install solar panels with battery storage
- @sus_example_conservation: Focus on energy conservation and efficiency first

@sus_example_coal
title: Coal Power Plant
subtitle: Short-term solution, long-term problems

Narration: Coal provides cheap, reliable energy now but contributes to climate change, air pollution, and resource depletion. It moves away from the healthy environment described in most holistic contexts.

Narration: **Fails sustainability check** - undermines the future resource base through environmental degradation.

@sus_example_solar
title: Solar with Storage
subtitle: Long-term thinking

Narration: Solar panels require higher upfront investment but provide clean, renewable energy that doesn't degrade the environment. They support a future resource base that includes clean air and stable climate.

Narration: **Passes sustainability check** - moves toward the healthy future resource base described in your holistic context.

@sus_example_conservation
title: Conservation First
subtitle: Reducing demand sustainably

Narration: Energy conservation reduces environmental impact while saving money. It builds habits and systems that support long-term sustainability while meeting immediate needs more efficiently.

Narration: **Passes sustainability check** - reduces pressure on future resource base while meeting current needs.

@sus_learn_more
title: Understanding Sustainability
subtitle: Future Resource Base Thinking

Narration: Your sustainability analysis should consider:

**Environmental Impact**: How does this action affect the four ecosystem processes (water cycle, mineral cycle, energy flow, community dynamics)?

**Social Impact**: How does this action affect the social conditions needed for your future resource base?

**Your Behavior**: Does this action align with the behaviors you identified as necessary for your social environment to be supportive?

Narration: The key question is whether this action moves you toward or away from the future you described in your holistic context. Sometimes short-term sacrifice is necessary for long-term sustainability.
