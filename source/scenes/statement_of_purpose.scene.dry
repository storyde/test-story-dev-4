Narration: Since you're here representing an organization, we need to be clear about its fundamental purpose. Not your mission statement or marketing copy, but the real reason your organization exists.

Narration: If your organization disappeared tomorrow, what would the world lose?

Narration: A cleaning robot rolls by, spraying the sidewalk with what appears to be orange juice instead of disinfectant. Its cheerful voice announces:

Robotvoice: CLEANING COMPLETE! HAVE A CITRUSY DAY!

Narration: That's an organization that's lost sight of its real purpose. What is your organization's true contribution to the world?

Narration: A hospital's purpose isn't "to make money from sick people" - it's "to heal and restore health." A school's purpose isn't "to process students" - it's "to develop human potential and knowledge."

Narration: A good purpose statement captures the positive change your organization creates in the world. It's the "why" behind everything you do.

Narration: Even a factory's purpose isn't just "to make things" - it might be "to create tools that improve people's lives" or "to transform raw materials into useful products."

- @back_to_purpose: I understand. Let me choose our purpose.
